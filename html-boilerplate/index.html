        <br>

        <h4>Word Styles</h4>
        <p><strong>p</strong> - paragraph</p>
        <p><strong>strong</strong> - bold</p>
        <p><strong>em</strong> - italic</p>
        <br>
        <p>You're telling me a <strong>shrimp</strong> fried this rice?</p>
        <p>What the <em>hell</em> are you talking about?</p>

        <br>

        <h4>A Sample Paragraph</h4>
        <p>Visual Studio Code has a shortcut where you can type 'lorem' and press tab to produce a whole bunch of sample text.</p>
        <p><em>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Dicta, rerum ipsum! Ut soluta adipisci fugiat earum et. Ratione aut assumenda ut minus, quaerat eum delectus aliquid neque voluptate reiciendis saepe?"</em></p>
      
        <br>

        <h4>Unordered List</h4>
        <p><strong>ul</strong> - bullet point list</p>
        <p><strong>ol</strong> - umbered list</p>
        <p><strong>li</strong> - list item</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <h4>Links</h4>
        <p><strong>a</strong> - anchor, a link to a different piece of media</p>
        <p><strong>href</strong> - [ATTRIBUTE] hypertext reference whose value is the link we're directed to</p>
        <p><em>a href="[INSERT LINK HERE]"</em></p>
        <p><strong>target</strong> - [ATTRIBUTE] determines whether a new tab will be opened or not. If not, will default to opening in the same tab. Make value "_blank" to open a new tab</p>
        <p><em>target="_blank"</em></p>
        <p><strong>rel</strong> - [ATTRIBUTE] describes the relation between the current page and the linked document. "noopener" prevents the opened link from getting access to the original webpage. "noreferrer" prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage has a link to it, includes the noopener behavior so can be used on its own. These are simply for security (e.g. phishing attacks)</p>
        <p><em>rel="noopener noreferrer"</em></p>
        <br>
        <p><em>a href="[INSERT LINK HERE]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"</em></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Absolute links</strong> - links to pages on other external websites</p>
        <p><strong>Relative links</strong> - links to pages within our own website</p>
        <p>When it comes to relative links, a file name is enough. But if the file you want to link to is in a folder/directory within your main folder/directory, you need to write "./[FOLDER]/[FILENAME].[FORMAT]" The number of periods at the start determine how many steps you need to take to reach from the current folder to the folder you want. (e.g. a folder within a folder needs two ../)</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>a href="./pages/about.html"</em></p>
        <br>
           <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images">An ABSOLUTE link that opens in the same tab</a>
        <br>
           <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An ABSOLUTE link that opens a new tab</a>
        <br>
           <a href="./samplepage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A RELATIVE link that opens a page in the same folder</a>
        <br>
           <a href="./pages/lists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A RELATIVE link that opens a page in a sub folder</a>
 
        <br>
        <br>

        <h4>Images</h4>
        <p><strong>img</strong> - displays images</p>
        <p><strong>src</strong> - [ATTRIBUTE] tells the browser where the image file is located, uses absolute and relative paths too</p>
        <p><strong>alt</strong> - [ATTRIBUTE] alternative text</p>
        <p><strong>width/height</strong> - [ATTRIBUTE] determines width and height of image, it's a good habit to still specify even if the size is correct/you're using CSS for it</p>
        <br>
           <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTwyXeKDN29AmZgZPLS7n0Bepe8QmVappBwZCeA3XWEbWNdiDFB" alt="A white dog raising its paw to its face with a scrunched expression" height="300" width="300">
        <br>
        <p><strong>JPG images</strong> - for large color palettes and small file size, good for gradients</p>
        <p><strong>GIF images</strong> - for simple animations, bad for large color palettes</p>
        <p><strong>PNG images</strong> - for large image files and transparent pixels</p>
        <p><strong>SVG images</strong> - for vector-based graphics, good for responsive design, and same uses as PNGs</p>

       <br>

       <h4>File Organization</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Don't use any capital letters</li>
        <li>Don't use any spaces, use hyphens</li>
        <li>Keep names as simple and easily-typable as possible because you need to type out file paths in full</li>
       </ul>

       <br>

       <h4>How to Write a Good Commit Message</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Always be specific about what changes you made (provide a subject)</li>
        <li>Say WHY you made that change</li>
        <li>Someone that's just joined your programming team should be able to understand fully</li>
        <li>Describe the problem your commit solves and how</li>
        <li>Just type git commit without the -m to open up a new window and be able to type multiple lines</li>
        <li>Commit wheneer there's a meaningful change in code</li>
       </ul>

       <br>

       <h4>Introduction to CSS</h4>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>*</strong> - universal selector, selects every element</li>
         <li><strong>Type selector</strong> - selects all elements of the given element type</li>
         <li><strong>Class selector</strong> - selects all elements with the given class (an attribute you place on an element class="[NAME]"), these selectors start with a period (.), multiple classes are separated by a space, multiple-worded names are separated by a hyphen</li>
         <li><strong>ID selector</strong> - like a class selector but can only be used once per page and cannot have any spaces, these selectors start with a #, use sparingly</li>
         <li><strong>Grouping selectors</strong> - for when multiple classes share some similar declarations and some unique ones, the similar ones can be grouped in a comma-separated list and the unique declarations can be specified individually</li>
         <li><strong>Chaining selectors</strong> - for when a single element has two classes and you want to give a unique declaration for that specific one, type the classes as a period-separated list, can also do this with IDs if you use a # as a separator</li>
         <li><strong>Descendant combinator</strong> - for when you want to select a specific class within a specific class</li>
         <li>Create any .css file, usually named "style" or "styles"</li>
         <li>OR embed internal CSS in the HTML file itself in style tags in the head tag of the file, good for adding unique styles to a single page</li>
         <li>OR embed inline CSS with the HTML element itself, but it's not recommended (e.g. style="color: white; background-color: black;")</li>
         <li>Using quotation marks is recommended for fonts with spaces, digits, or punctuation besides hyphens</li>
         <li>Don't use quotation marks for fonts that are intended as back ups (e.g. sans-serif)</li>
         <li>Set height or width to 'auto' to make it so that the image retains its original proportions (this is called not "hard-coding" the value)</li>
      </ul>
